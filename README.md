Kenan Portfolio 

when i was trying to design the website on google slides it came out how i wanted it to be but when it came down to code it, it was so stressful trying to get the navbar in the middle writing different codes to make it work adding more classes, divs, etc etc. so i decided to go on a different design another one i wanted to do a clean simple look with cool little detail that would help the website seems more cool and poppy and to my likings.
