# Portfolio Project 
Hello I'm Kenan Kong 

# Design and Planning out
I wanted to go for a simple and clean design nothing to major since im still new to coding and wanted to show my full potential as a young coder. When clicking on the webite is will show a image of my hometown Long Beach, CA at the Lighthouse with a little description about me and a button when you click on it it goes directly to the second section, the second section is about me a little bio i wrote what i learn from General Assembly, also add a navbar on top with link that goes to that link. Third section is connection or contacts if people want to see my work, codes, email, and resume.

# HTML 
when coding the website on HTML was kinda tricking was having trouble putting everything in order if not my images or text would be all over the place

# CSS
not the best at it but will be soon, tried different methods and code to get things how i wanted to had to break some rules from the online world

# JavaScript 
didn't used javascript mostly because the way how i design the website wasn't going to be needing javascript(correct me if i am wrong)

# Images & Fonts
light house image i found in unsplash.com the second image of me was taking by a friend, fonts i used was "Lato" i found while scrolling through the site

# MVP Goals
- having a welcome page
- bio
- links to github etc.

# Stretch Goals 
by the end of the course at General Assembly i will be still working on my website for future jobs and practing coding and web designing. i want to learn more about CSS HTML JAVASCRIPT and more !

# Issue or Roadblocks
i had ALOT of issues and roadblock when coding it, took many breaks and meditation to relive some stress i never thought it was this stressful to design and code a website
- HTML was pretty standard for me 
- CSS was geting kind stressful because of flex: grid: etc. placing everything how i wanted when have OCD
- JAVASCRIPT didnt used mush but tried to figure out a way of using it for the website probably for a sticky navbar or something i haven't thought about yet
